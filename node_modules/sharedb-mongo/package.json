  "readme": "# sharedb-mongo\n\nMongoDB database adapter for [sharedb](https://github.com/share/sharedb). This\ndriver can be used both as a snapshot store and oplog.\n\nSnapshots are stored where you'd expect (the named collection with _id=id). In\naddition, operations are stored in `o_COLLECTION`. For example, if you have\na `users` collection, the operations are stored in `o_users`.\n\nJSON document snapshots in sharedb-mongo are unwrapped so you can use mongo\nqueries directly against JSON documents. (They just have some extra fields in\nthe form of `_v` and `_type`). It is safe to query documents directly with the\nMongoDB driver or command line. Any read only mongo features, including find,\naggregate, and map reduce are safe to perform concurrent with ShareDB.\n\nHowever, you must *always* use ShareDB to edit documents. Never use the\nMongoDB driver or command line to directly modify any documents that ShareDB\nmight create or edit. ShareDB must be used to properly persist operations\ntogether with snapshots.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n`sharedb-mongo` wraps native [mongodb](https://github.com/mongodb/node-\nmongodb-native), and it supports the same configuration options.\n\nThere are two ways to instantiate a sharedb-mongo wrapper:\n\n1. The simplest way is to invoke the module and pass in your mongo DB\narguments as arguments to the module function. For example:\n\nvar db = require('sharedb-mongo')('localhost:27017/test');\n\n2. If you already have a mongo connection that you want to use, you\nalternatively can pass it into sharedb-mongo:\n\nrequire('mongodb').connect('localhost:27017/test', function(err, mongo) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  var db = require('sharedb-mongo')({mongo: mongo});\n});\n\n\n## Error codes\n\nMongo errors are passed back directly. Additional error codes:\n\n#### 4100 -- Bad request - DB\n\n* 4101 -- Invalid op version\n* 4102 -- Invalid collection name\n* 4103 -- $where queries disabled\n* 4104 -- $mapReduce queries disabled\n* 4105 -- $aggregate queries disabled\n\n#### 5100 -- Internal error - DB\n\n* 5101 -- Already closed\n* 5102 -- Snapshot missing last operation field\n* 5103 -- Missing ops from requested version\n\n\n## MIT License\nCopyright (c) 2015 by Joseph Gentle and Nate Smith\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
