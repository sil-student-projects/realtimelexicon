### React
This is a simple React tutorial. I am working towards recreating the functionality of Dr. Lu's example. It requires that you use this JSFiddle because I am yet to do the extra work to make it work locally. https://jsfiddle.net/6rhdpt5c/92/

### Scotch
This is a simple ShareJS tutorial. Running it is not straightforward.

Briefly, it requires that you:
- Install Redis first.
- Then to run: You have to run Redis first, then run your _node server.js_.

### ShareDB_Examples-Master
We are working towards dynamically generating the path and deleting then reinserting small parts of the tree. It is run using `node server.js` and it will be running at *http://localhost:8080/jsoneditor.html*.

## ShareScotch
Experimenting with modifying the Scotch directory to work with ShareDB.
