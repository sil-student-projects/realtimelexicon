##This is Dave's branch for the RealTimeLexicon GitHub.##
The directory structure is as follows.

###keyword-wrangler directory###
As things currently stand, the nodecraftsman tutorial (which I am HEAVILY modifying)
is in the keyword-wrangler directory. That directory contains its own README
with instructions specefic to it.

###miscellaneous directory###
The miscellaneous directory contains past work from this repo.

###experiments directory###
The experiments directory is supposed to be a place to put isolated code segments
for experimentation purposes. But maybe if something that works is stumbled on,
just keep it in here.
